The goal of this vignette is to describe the basic functionality of the 
`wdman` package.

## Introduction

`wdman` (Webdriver Manager) is an R package that allows the user to manage
the downloading/running of third party binaries relating to the webdriver/selenium
projects. The package was inspired by a similar node package 
[webdriver-manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webdriver-manager).

The checking/downloading of binaries is handled by the [binman](https://github.com/johndharrison/binman) package and the
running of the binaries as processes is handled by the [subprocess](https://github.com/lbartnik/subprocess) package.


The `wdman` package currently manages the following binaries:

* [Selenium standalone binary](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)
* [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)
* [PhantomJS binary](http://phantomjs.org/download.html)
* [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
* [iedriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver)

Associated with the above are five functions to download/manage the binaries:

* selenium(...)
* chrome(...)
* phantomjs(...)
* gecko(...)
* iedriver(...)

The driver functions take a number of common arguments (verbose, check, 
retcommand) which we describe: 

### Verbosity

Each of the driver functions has a `verbose` argument which controls 
message output to the user. If `verbose = TRUE` then messages are relayed
to the user to inform them when drivers are checked/downloaded/ran. The
default value for the driver functions is `TRUE`.

```
selServ <- selenium(verbose = TRUE)

## checking Selenium Server versions:

## BEGIN: PREDOWNLOAD

## BEGIN: DOWNLOAD

## BEGIN: POSTDOWNLOAD

## checking chromedriver versions:

## BEGIN: PREDOWNLOAD

## BEGIN: DOWNLOAD

## BEGIN: POSTDOWNLOAD

## checking geckodriver versions:

## BEGIN: PREDOWNLOAD

## BEGIN: DOWNLOAD

## BEGIN: POSTDOWNLOAD

## checking phantomjs versions:

## BEGIN: PREDOWNLOAD

## BEGIN: DOWNLOAD

## BEGIN: POSTDOWNLOAD

selServ$stop()

## [1] TRUE
```

versus's

```
selServ <- selenium(verbose = FALSE)
selServ$stop()

## [1] TRUE
```


### Check for updates 

Each driver function has a `check` argument. If `check= TRUE` the 
function will liaise with the driver repository for any updates. If new
driver versions are available these will be downloaded. The
[binman](https://github.com/johndharrison/binman) package is used for
this purpose.

### Command line output

For diagnostic purposes each driver function has a `retcommand` argument.
If `retcommand = TRUE` the command that would have been launched as a 
process is instead returned as a string. As an example:

```
selCommand <- selenium(retcommand = TRUE, verbose = FALSE, check = FALSE)
selCommand

## [1] "/usr/bin/java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/home/john/.local/share/binman_chromedriver/linux64/2.27/chromedriver -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=/home/john/.local/share/binman_geckodriver/linux64/0.13.0/geckodriver -Dphantomjs.binary.path=/home/john/.local/share/binman_phantomjs/linux64/2.1.1/phantomjs-2.1.1-linux-x86_64/bin/phantomjs -jar /home/john/.local/share/binman_seleniumserver/generic/3.0.1/selenium-server-standalone-3.0.1.jar -port 4567"
```

```
chromeCommand <- chrome(retcommand = TRUE, verbose = FALSE, check = FALSE)
chromeCommand

## [1] "/home/john/.local/share/binman_chromedriver/linux64/2.27/chromedriver --port=4567 --url-base=wd/hub --verbose"
```

## Selenium Standalone

The `selenium` function manages the Selenium Standalone binary. It can
check for updates at http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html
and run the resulting binaries as processes. 

### Running the Selenium binary

The binary takes a port argument which defaults to `port = 4567L`. There
are a number of optional arguments to use a particular version of the
binaries related to browsers selenium may control. By default the
`selenium` function will look to use the latest version of each. 

```
selServ <- selenium(verbose = FALSE, check = FALSE)
selServ$process

## Process Handle
## command   : /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/home/john/.local/share/binman_chromedriver/linux64/2.27/chromedriver -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=/home/john/.local/share/binman_geckodriver/linux64/0.13.0/geckodriver -Dphantomjs.binary.path=/home/john/.local/share/binman_phantomjs/linux64/2.1.1/phantomjs-2.1.1-linux-x86_64/bin/phantomjs -jar /home/john/.local/share/binman_seleniumserver/generic/3.0.1/selenium-server-standalone-3.0.1.jar -port 4567
## system id : 105698
## state     : running
```

The selenium function returns a list of functions and a handle representing 
the running process.

The returned `output`, `error` and `log` functions give access to the 
stdout/stderr pipes and the cumulative stdout/stderr messages rerspectively.

```
selServ$log()

##

The `stop` function sends a signal that terminates the process:

```
selServ$stop()

## [1] TRUE
```

### Available browsers

By default the `selenium` function includes paths to chromedriver/geckodriver/
phantomjs so that the Chrome/Firefox and PhantomJS browsers are available 
respectively. All versions (chromever, geckover etc) are given as "latest". 
If the user passes a value of NULL for any driver it will be excluded.

On Windows operating systems the option to included the Internet Explorer
driver is also given. This is set to `iedrver = NULL` so not ran by default.
Set it to `iedrver = "latest"` or a specific version string to include it
on your Windows.

### Issues with Windows and Firefox/GeckoDriver

To run the binaries related to the Selenium/webdriver projects `wdman` 
uses the R package `subprocess`. Currently the windows version of this
package uses blocking pipes when it instantiates a process. The causes 
issues with firefox/geckodriver when called from selenium. A "shim" is 
required as the stderr pipe is blocking and firefox/geckodriver waits for 
the pipe to free. 

An example of implementing this shim for windows can be seen in the 
[Rselenium](https://github.com/ropensci/RSelenium) package. The 
`rsDriver` function currently implements such a shim. It basically 
clears the error pipe so the firefox/geckodriver can finish its startup.

## Chrome Driver

The `chrome` function manages the Chrome Driver binary. It can
check for updates at https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html
and run the resulting binaries as processes. 

**The `chrome` function runs the Chrome Driver binary as a standalone
process. It takes a default `port` argument `port = 4567L`. Users can then
connect directly to the chrome driver to drive a chrome browser.**

Similarly to the `selenium` function the `chrome` function returns a list 
of four functions and a handle to the underlying running process.

```
cDrv <- chrome(verbose = FALSE, check = FALSE)
cDrv$process

## Process Handle
## command   : /home/john/.local/share/binman_chromedriver/linux64/2.27/chromedriver --port=4567 --url-base=wd/hub --verbose
## system id : 105886
## state     : running
```

```
cDrv$log()

## $stderr
## character(0)
## 
## $stdout
## [1] "Starting ChromeDriver 2.27.440175 (9bc1d90b8bfa4dd181fbbf769a5eb5e575574320) on port 4567"
## [2] "Only local connections are allowed."
```

```
cDrv$stop()

## [1] TRUE
```
## PhantomJS

The `phantomjs` function manages the PhantomJS binary. It can
check for updates at https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads
and run the resulting binaries as processes. 

## Gecko Driver

The `gecko` function manages the Gecko Driver binary. It can
check for updates at https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
and run the resulting binaries as processes. 

## IE Driver
The `iedriver` function manages the Internet Explorer Driver binary. It can
check for updates at http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html
and run the resulting binaries as processes (the iedriver is distributed 
currently with the Selenium standalone binary amongst other files).
